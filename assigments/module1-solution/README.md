# coursera-test
repository for testing of the course

This proyect is about a little app where you can write the ingredients you use for your lunch, and this app tells if you are eating too much or simply you are ok, so it wants you to Enjoy it!

Of course, this app has some rules, e. g., you cann´t write empty item because for then this will not have to count.

I am Andrés, from Colombia, and not have a C1 english :(, but I am doing my best. :)
